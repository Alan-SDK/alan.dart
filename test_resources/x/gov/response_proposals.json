          "description": "Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRtR7qkeaZCpCzHDwHgJeJAZdTrbmHLxFDYXhw7RoF1pp\n\nThe Cosmos Hub's state machine handles spam prevention of governance proposals by means of a deposit system. A governance proposal is only considered eligible for voting by the whole validator set if a certain amount of staking token is deposited on the proposal. The intention is that the deposit will be burned if a proposal is spam or has caused a negative externality to the Cosmos community (such as wasting stakeholders’ time having to review the proposal).\n\nIn the current implementation of the governance module used in the Cosmos Hub, the deposit is burned if a proposal does not pass, regardless of how close the final tally result may have been. For example, if 49% of stake votes in favor of a proposal while 51% votes against it, the deposit will still be burned. This seems to be an undesirable behavior as it disincentivizes anyone from creating or depositing on a proposal that might be slightly contentious but not spam, due to fear of losing the deposit minimum (currently 512 atoms). This will especially be the case as TextProposals will be used for signaling purposes, to gauge the sentiment of staked Atom holders. Disincentivizing proposals for which the outcome is uncertain would undermine that effort.\n\nWe instead propose that the deposit be returned on failed votes, and that the deposit only be burned on vetoed votes. If a proposal seems to be spam or is deemed to have caused a negative externality to Cosmos communninty, voters should vote NoWithVeto on the proposal. If >33% of the stake chooses to Veto a proposal, the deposits will then be burned. However, if a proposal gets rejected without being vetoed, the deposits should be returned to the depositors.  This proposal does not make any change to the current behavior for proposals that fail to meet quorum; if a proposal fails to meet quorum its deposit will be burned."

We deem the issue to be of high severity, as if exploited it can potentially degrade the security model of the chain's Proof of Stake system.  This vulnerability CANNOT lead to the theft of Atoms or creation of Atoms out of thin air. \n\n All in Bits has released a source code patch, Gaia v0.34.6, that closes the exploitable code path starting at block 482100. \n\n The proposed upgrade code Git hash is:  80234baf91a15dd9a7df8dca38677b66b8d148c1 \n\n As a proof of stake, we are putting some collateral behind this legitimacy of this bug and patch and encourage others familiar with the report to do so as well.  If the disclosed bug turns out to be fabricated or malicious in some way, we urge the Cosmos Hub governance to slash these Atoms by voting NoWithVeto on this proposal. \n\n We encourage validators and all users to upgrade their nodes to Gaia v0.34.6 before block 482100.  In the absence of another public bulletin board, we request validators to please vote Yes on this proposal AFTER they have upgraded their nodes to v0.34.6, as a method of signalling the readiness of the network for the upgrade."

          "description": "Read here, or on https://ipfs.ink/e/QmRhQycV19QiTQGLuPzPHfJwCioj1wDeHHtZvxiHegTFDd \n\nThis proposal supercedes proposal number 9, which contains conflicting numbers in the title and body. \n\nIn the Cosmos Hub, the total number of active validators is currently capped at 100, ordered by total delegated Atoms. This number was originally proposed in the Cosmos whitepaper section titled [Limitations on the Number of Validators](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#limitations-on-the-number-of-validators 4). This number was chosen as a relatively conservative estimate, as at the time of writing, it was unclear how many widely distributed nodes Tendermint consensus could scale to over the public internet.  \n\nHowever, since then, we have seen empirically through the running of the Game of Stakes incentivized testnet that Tendermint Core with Gaia state machine can operate with over 180 validators at reasonable average block times of <7 seconds. The Game of Stakes results empirically show that adding validators should not delay consensus at small block sizes. At large block sizes, the time it takes for the block to gossip to all validators may increase depending on the newfound network topology. However we view this as unlikely, and if it did become a problem, it could later be solved by known improvements at the p2p layer. The other tradeoff to increasing the number of validators is that the size of commits becomes ~25% larger due to more precommits being included, increasing the network and storage costs for nodes. This can also be resolved in the future with the integration of aggregate signatures. At the time of submission of this proposal, the minimum delegation to become a top 100 validator is 30,600 Atoms, a fairly high barrier to entry for new validators looking to enter the active validator set.  \n\nIn the Cosmos whitepaper, it states that the number of validators on the Hub will increase at a rate of 13% a year until it hits a cap of 300 validators. We propose scrapping this mechanism and instead increasing the max validators to 125 validators in the next chain upgrade with no further planned increases. Future increases to the validator set size will be originated through governance."

          "description": "This governance proposal is intended to act purely as a signalling proposal.  Throughout this history of the Cosmos Hub, there has been much debate about the impact that validators charging 0% commission has on the Cosmos Hub, particularly with respect to the decentralization of the Cosmos Hub and the sustainability for validator operations. \n\n Discussion around this topic has taken place in many places including numerous threads on the Cosmos Forum, public Telegram channels, and in-person meetups.  Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. \n\n There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission.  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 \n\n This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum.  It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. \n\n We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here:  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 \n\n Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. \n\n The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”.  A Yes vote is stating that they ARE harmful to the network's success, and a No vote is a statement that they are NOT harmful."

These changes drive the need for substantial resource and time requirements to ensure successful migration. Stargate represents a unique set of circumstances and is not intended to set precedent for future upgrades which are expected to be less dramatic.\nThere is a widespread consensus from many Cosmos stakeholders that these changes to core software components will enhance the performance and composability of the software and the value of the Cosmos Hub in a world of many blockchains.\nA Yes result on this proposal provides a clear signal that the Cosmos Hub accepts and understands the Stargate process and is prepared to approve an upgrade with proposed changes if the plan below is executed successfully.\nA No result would force a reconsideration of the tradeoffs in the Alternatives section and the forming a new plan to deliver IBC.\nSee the full proposal here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmbo3fF54tX3JdoHZNVLcSBrdkXLie56Vh2u29wLfs4PnW"
